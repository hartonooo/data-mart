steps:
1. import data_mart_weekly_sales.csv into SQL SERVER
2. data cleaning
3. data exploration:
    
    1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?

    9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

4. analyzing data:
    
    1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
    2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
    3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?
